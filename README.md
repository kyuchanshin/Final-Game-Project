# Final-Game-Project
1. Background
- This is a shooting game in which you ride a pirate ship on the sea and shoot other pirate ships with cannons.
  Basically, ships move on the sea, and you can use your keyboard to shoot cannons at your opponent's pirate ship.

2. Concept
  - The concept of the game was thought of in the movie Pirates of the Caribbean.
  Players who play the game get on a pirate ship and attack another pirate ship. Also, monsters of the sea, as well as other pirate ships, attack the pirate ship   that the player is on, and the player must attack the monster to avoid it.

3. Explanation
  - 1) Color Concept
    The game will be played in the sea, so most of the backgrounds will be set in blue, the index of the sea.
  - 2) Enemy
    The Kraken and other pirate ships are the opposing team attacking players in this game.
  - 3) Item
    The default attack is to shoot arrows, and from the time a player acquires a cannon icon during the game, a strengthened cannon will emerge from the pirate         ship.
  - 4) Ending
    If you take down all the enemies, you find the treasure of the sea, and the game ends
